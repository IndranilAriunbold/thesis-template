	abstract = {The pursuit of more intelligent and credible autonomous systems, akin to human society, has been a long-standing endeavor for humans. Leveraging the exceptional reasoning and planning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), LLM-based agents have been proposed and have achieved remarkable success across a wide array of tasks. Notably, LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) are considered a promising pathway towards realizing general artificial intelligence that is equivalent to or surpasses human-level intelligence. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of these studies, offering a systematic review of LLM-based MAS. Adhering to the workflow of LLM-based multi-agent systems, we synthesize a general structure encompassing five key components: profile, perception, self-action, mutual interaction, and evolution. This unified framework encapsulates much of the previous work in the field. Furthermore, we illuminate the extensive applications of LLM-based MAS in two principal areas: problem-solving and world simulation. Finally, we discuss in detail several contemporary challenges and provide insights into potential future directions in this domain.},

We employ a dialogical approach in this Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL) study, mirroring the ChatGPT conversational style. \&nbsp;A former student uses ChatGPT-4 to rewrite an essay, and the generated content is evaluated by free-to-use AI checking tools, Turnitin, and the module tutor.
Our findings illustrate that while ChatGPT-4 could generate a passable assignment, it lacks depth, criticality, and contextualisation.\&nbsp; Further, AI checking tools, while useful, exhibit limitations. However, the generated content could serve as a starting point for students, suggesting a possible shift in the educational paradigm with AI's integration.
The manuscript also underscores the importance of understanding and navigating AI responsibly, calling for clear guidelines for AI use and improved methods of detecting AI generated content. \&nbsp;While AI has emerged as an efficient tool for generating academic content, our study highlights the necessity of human-centric learning and critical thinking skills in academia, emphasising that AI should not replace personal research. \&nbsp;We also discuss potential changes to assessment methods in response to AI advancements, recommending strategies for both academic staff and students.

	abstract = {Background: Rare diseases affect millions worldwide but sometimes face limited research focus individually due to low prevalence. Many rare diseases do not have specific ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes and therefore cannot be reliably extracted from granular fields like “Diagnosis” and “Problem List” entries, which complicates tasks that require identification of patients with these conditions, including clinical trial recruitment and research efforts. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating the extraction of medical information, offering the potential to improve medical research, diagnosis, and management. However, most LLMs lack professional medical knowledge, especially concerning specific rare diseases, and cannot effectively manage rare disease data in its various ontological forms, making it unsuitable for these tasks. Objective: Our objective is to create an end-to-end system called AutoRD, which automates the extraction of rare-disease-related information from medical text, focusing on entities and their relations to other medical concepts, such as signs and symptoms. AutoRD integrates up-to-date ontologies with other structured knowledge and demonstrates superior performance in rare disease extraction tasks. We conduct various experiments to evaluate AutoRD’s performance, aiming to surpass common LLMs and traditional methods. Methods: AutoRD is a pipeline system that involves data preprocessing, entity extraction, relation extraction, entity calibration, and knowledge graph construction. We implement this system using GPT4 and medical knowledge graphs developed from the open-source Human Phenotype and Orphanet ontologies, utilizing techniques such as chain-of-thought reasoning and prompt engineering. We quantitatively evaluate our system’s performance in entity extraction, relation extraction, and knowledge graph construction. The experiment uses the well-curated dataset RareDis2023, which contains medical literature focused on rare disease entities and their relations, making it an ideal dataset for training and testing our methodology. Results: On the RareDis2023 dataset, AutoRD achieves an overall entity extraction F1 score of 56.1\% and a relation extraction F1 score of 38.6\%, marking a 14.4\% improvement over the baseline LLM. Notably, the F1 score for rare disease entity extraction reaches 83.5\%, indicating high precision and recall in identifying rare disease mentions. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating LLMs with medical ontologies in extracting complex rare disease information. Conclusions: AutoRD is an automated end-to-end system for extracting rare disease information from text to build knowledge graphs, addressing critical limitations of existing LLMs by improving identification of these diseases and connecting them to related clinical features. This work underscores the significant potential of LLMs in transforming healthcare, particularly in the rare disease domain. By leveraging ontology-enhanced LLMs, AutoRD constructs a robust medical knowledge base that incorporates up-to-date rare disease information, facilitating improved identification of patients and resulting in more inclusive research and trial candidacy efforts.},

Despite these separate efforts, no investigation has been done into the intersection of these two fields. In this work, we provide an evaluation of model compression via knowledge distillation on efficient attention transformers. We provide cost-performance trade-offs for the compression of state-of-the-art efficient attention architectures and the gains made in performance in comparison to their full attention counterparts. Furthermore, we introduce a new long-context Named Entity Recognition dataset, GONERD, to train and test the performance of NER models on long sequences. We find that distilled efficient attention transformers can preserve a significant amount of original model performance, preserving up to 98.6\% across short-context tasks (GLUE, SQUAD, CoNLL-2003), up to 94.6\% across long-context Question-and-Answering tasks (HotpotQA, TriviaQA), and up to 98.8\% on long-context Named Entity Recognition (GONERD), while decreasing inference times by up to 57.8\%. We find that, for most models on most tasks, performing knowledge distillation is an effective method to yield high-performing efficient attention models with low costs.},

	abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

Large language models (LLMs) applied in this field can describe driving scenes and behaviors with a level of accuracy similar to human perception, particularly in visual tasks. Meanwhile, the rapid development of edge computing, with its advantage of proximity to data sources, has made edge devices increasingly important in autonomous driving. Edge devices process data locally, reducing transmission delays and bandwidth usage, and achieving faster response times. In this work, we propose a driving behavior narration and reasoning framework that applies LLMs to edge devices. The framework consists of multiple roadside units, with LLMs deployed on each unit. These roadside units collect road data and communicate via 5G NSR/NR networks. Our experiments show that LLMs deployed on edge devices can achieve satisfactory response speeds. Additionally, we propose a prompt strategy to enhance the narration and reasoning performance of the system. This strategy integrates multi-modal information, including environmental, agent, and motion data.

This results in low task-completion accuracy, increased delays, and higher power consumption. In this work, we introduce Less-is-More, a novel fine-tuning-free function-calling scheme for dynamic tool selection. Our approach is based on the key insight that selectively reducing the number of tools available to LLMs significantly improves their function-calling performance, execution time, and power efficiency on edge devices. Experimental results with state-of-the-art LLMs on edge hardware show agentic success rate improvements, with execution time reduced by up to 70\% and power consumption by up to 40\%.},

Previous research in this field often focuses on training agents with limited knowledge within isolated environments, which diverges significantly from human learning processes, and thus makes the agents hard to achieve human-like decisions. Recently, through the acquisition of vast amounts of web knowledge, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in achieving human-level intelligence. This has sparked an upsurge in studies investigating LLM-based autonomous agents. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of these studies, delivering a systematic review of the field of LLM-based autonomous agents from a holistic perspective. More specifically, we first discuss the construction of LLM-based autonomous agents, for which we propose a unified framework that encompasses a majority of the previous work. Then, we present a comprehensive overview of the diverse applications of LLM-based autonomous agents in the fields of social science, natural science, and engineering. Finally, we delve into the evaluation strategies commonly used for LLM-based autonomous agents. Based on the previous studies, we also present several challenges and future directions in this field.

However, these frameworks predominantly serve developers with extensive technical expertise - a significant limitation considering that only 0.03 \% of the global population possesses the necessary programming skills. This stark accessibility gap raises a fundamental question: Can we enable everyone, regardless of technical background, to build their own LLM agents using natural language alone? To address this challenge, we introduce AutoAgent-a Fully-Automated and highly Self-Developing framework that enables users to create and deploy LLM agents through Natural Language Alone. Operating as an autonomous Agent Operating System, AutoAgent comprises four key components: i) Agentic System Utilities, ii) LLM-powered Actionable Engine, iii) Self-Managing File System, and iv) Self-Play Agent Customization module. This lightweight yet powerful system enables efficient and dynamic creation and modification of tools, agents, and workflows without coding requirements or manual intervention. Beyond its code-free agent development capabilities, AutoAgent also serves as a versatile multi-agent system for General AI Assistants. Comprehensive evaluations on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate AutoAgent's effectiveness in generalist multi-agent tasks, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, AutoAgent's Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-related capabilities have shown consistently superior performance compared to many alternative LLM-based solutions.},

	abstract = {For a long time, humanity has pursued artificial intelligence (AI) equivalent to or surpassing the human level, with AI agents considered a promising vehicle for this pursuit. AI agents are artificial entities that sense their environment, make decisions, and take actions. Many efforts have been made to develop intelligent agents, but they mainly focus on advancement in algorithms or training strategies to enhance specific capabilities or performance on particular tasks. Actually, what the community lacks is a general and powerful model to serve as a starting point for designing AI agents that can adapt to diverse scenarios. Due to the versatile capabilities they demonstrate, large language models (LLMs) are regarded as potential sparks for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), offering hope for building general AI agents. Many researchers have leveraged LLMs as the foundation to build AI agents and have achieved significant progress. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive survey on LLM-based agents. We start by tracing the concept of agents from its philosophical origins to its development in AI, and explain why LLMs are suitable foundations for agents. Building upon this, we present a general framework for LLM-based agents, comprising three main components: brain, perception, and action, and the framework can be tailored for different applications. Subsequently, we explore the extensive applications of LLM-based agents in three aspects: single-agent scenarios, multi-agent scenarios, and humanagent cooperation. Following this, we delve into agent societies, exploring the behavior and personality of LLM-based agents, the social phenomena that emerge from an agent society, and the insights they offer for human society. Finally, we discuss several key topics and open problems within the field. A repository for the related papers at https://github.com/WooooDyy/LLM-Agent-Paper-List.},

	abstract = {Building generalist agents that can handle diverse tasks and evolve themselves across different environments is a long-term goal in the AI community. Large language models (LLMs) are considered a promising foundation to build such agents due to their generalized capabilities. Current approaches either have LLM-based agents imitate expert-provided trajectories step-by-step, requiring human supervision, which is hard to scale and limits environmental exploration; or they let agents explore and learn in isolated environments, resulting in specialist agents with limited generalization. In this paper, we take the first step towards building generally-capable LLM-based agents with self-evolution ability. We identify a trinity of ingredients: 1) diverse environments for agent exploration and learning, 2) a trajectory set to equip agents with basic capabilities and prior knowledge, and 3) an effective and scalable evolution method. We propose AGENTGYM, a new framework featuring a variety of environments and tasks for broad, real-time, uni-format, and concurrent agent exploration. AGENTGYM also includes a database with expanded instructions, a benchmark suite, and high-quality trajectories across environments. Next, we propose a novel method, AGENTEVOL, to investigate the potential of agent self-evolution beyond previously seen data across tasks and environments. Experimental results show that the evolved agents can achieve results comparable to SOTA models. We release the AGENTGYM suite, including the platform, dataset, benchmark, checkpoints, and algorithm implementations.},

Although LLMs demonstrate emergent abilities and broad expertise across natural language domains, their inherent unpredictability makes the implementation of LLM agents challenging, resulting in a gap between related research and the real-world implementation of such systems. To bridge this gap, this paper frames actionable insights and considerations from the research community in the context of established application paradigms to enable the construction and facilitate the informed deployment of robust LLM agents. Namely, we position relevant research findings into four broad categories—Planning, Memory, Tools, and Control Flow—based on common practices in applicationfocused literature and highlight practical considerations to make when designing agentic LLMs for real-world applications, such as handling stochasticity and managing resources efficiently. While we do not conduct empirical evaluations, we do provide the necessary background for discussing critical aspects of agentic LLM designs, both in academia and industry.},

	abstract = {Traditional autonomous driving methods adopt a modular design, decomposing tasks into sub-tasks. In contrast, end-to-end autonomous driving directly outputs actions from raw sensor data, avoiding error accumulation. However, training an end-to-end model requires a comprehensive dataset; otherwise, the model exhibits poor generalization capabilities. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been applied to enhance the generalization capabilities of end-toend driving models. Most studies explore LLMs in an open-loop manner, where the output actions are compared to those of experts without direct feedback from the real world, while others examine closed-loop results only in simulations. This paper proposes an efficient architecture that integrates multimodal LLMs into end-to-end driving models operating in closed-loop settings in real-world environments. In our architecture, the LLM periodically processes raw sensor data to generate high-level driving instructions, effectively guiding the end-to-end model, even at a slower rate than the raw sensor data. This architecture relaxes the tradeoff between the latency and inference quality of the LLM. It also allows us to choose from a wide variety of LLMs to improve high-level driving instructions and minimize fine-tuning costs. Consequently, our architecture reduces data collection requirements because the LLMs do not directly output actions; we only need to train a simple imitation learning model to output actions. In our experiments, the training data for the end-to-end model in a real-world environment consists of only simple obstacle configurations with one traffic cone, while the test environment is more complex and contains multiple obstacles placed in various positions. Experiments show that the proposed architecture enhances the generalization capabilities of the end-to-end model even without fine-tuning the LLM.},

In this paper, we explore the use of LLMs to generate both reasoning traces and task-speciﬁc actions in an interleaved manner, allowing for greater synergy between the two: reasoning traces help the model induce, track, and update action plans as well as handle exceptions, while actions allow it to interface with and gather additional information from external sources such as knowledge bases or environments. We apply our approach, named ReAct, to a diverse set of language and decision making tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness over state-of-the-art baselines in addition to improved human interpretability and trustworthiness. Concretely, on question answering (HotpotQA) and fact veriﬁcation (Fever), ReAct overcomes prevalent issues of hallucination and error propagation in chain-of-thought reasoning by interacting with a simple Wikipedia API, and generating human-like task-solving trajectories that are more interpretable than baselines without reasoning traces. Furthermore, on two interactive decision making benchmarks (ALFWorld and WebShop), ReAct outperforms imitation and reinforcement learning methods by an absolute success rate of 34\% and 10\% respectively, while being prompted with only one or two in-context examples.},

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), an ad hoc approach that augments LMs with retrieval of relevant knowledge, decreases such issues. However, indiscriminately retrieving and incorporating a fixed number of retrieved passages, regardless of whether retrieval is necessary, or passages are relevant, diminishes LM versatility or can lead to unhelpful response generation. We introduce a new framework called Self-Reflective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Self-RAG) that enhances an LM's quality and factuality through retrieval and self-reflection. Our framework trains a single arbitrary LM that adaptively retrieves passages on-demand, and generates and reflects on retrieved passages and its own generations using special tokens, called reflection tokens. Generating reflection tokens makes the LM controllable during the inference phase, enabling it to tailor its behavior to diverse task requirements. Experiments show that Self-RAG (7B and 13B parameters) significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs and retrieval-augmented models on a diverse set of tasks. Specifically, Self-RAG outperforms ChatGPT and retrieval-augmented Llama2-chat on Open-domain QA, reasoning and fact verification tasks, and it shows significant gains in improving factuality and citation accuracy for long-form generations relative to these models.},

Although retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a practicable complement to LLMs, it relies heavily on the relevance of retrieved documents, raising concerns about how the model behaves if retrieval goes wrong. To this end, we propose the Corrective Retrieval Augmented Generation (CRAG) to improve the robustness of generation. Specifically, a lightweight retrieval evaluator is designed to assess the overall quality of retrieved documents for a query, returning a confidence degree based on which different knowledge retrieval actions can be triggered. Since retrieval from static and limited corpora can only return sub-optimal documents, large-scale web searches are utilized as an extension for augmenting the retrieval results. Besides, a decompose-then-recompose algorithm is designed for retrieved documents to selectively focus on key information and filter out irrelevant information in them. CRAG is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly coupled with various RAG-based approaches. Experiments on four datasets covering short- and long-form generation tasks show that CRAG can significantly improve the performance of RAG-based approaches.},

	abstract = {Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models (LLMs), which incorporate the non-parametric knowledge from external knowledge bases into LLMs, have emerged as a promising approach to enhancing response accuracy in several tasks, such as Question-Answering (QA). However, even though there are various approaches dealing with queries of different complexities, they either handle simple queries with unnecessary computational overhead or fail to adequately address complex multi-step queries; yet, not all user requests fall into only one of the simple or complex categories. In this work, we propose a novel adaptive QA framework that can dynamically select the most suitable strategy for (retrieval-augmented) LLMs from the simplest to the most sophisticated ones based on the query complexity. Also, this selection process is operationalized with a classifier, which is a smaller LM trained to predict the complexity level of incoming queries with automatically collected labels, obtained from actual predicted outcomes of models and inherent inductive biases in datasets. This approach offers a balanced strategy, seamlessly adapting between the iterative and single-step retrieval-augmented LLMs, as well as the noretrieval methods, in response to a range of query complexities. We validate our model on a set of open-domain QA datasets, covering multiple query complexities, and show that ours enhances the overall efficiency and accuracy of QA systems, compared to relevant baselines including the adaptive retrieval approaches.

In this paper, we report three studies that we conducted: on user interfaces and the functions of three password managers; a usability test and an interview study; and an online questionnaire study about users and non-users of password managers, which also compares experts and non-experts regarding their use (or non-use) of password managers. Our findings show that usability is not a major problem, rather lack of trust and transparency are the main reasons for the low adoption of password managers. Users of password managers have trust and security concerns, while there are a few issues with the user interfaces and functions of password managers.},

	abstract = {Children use technology from a very young age, and often have to authenticate themselves. Yet very little attention has been paid to designing authentication specifically for this particular target group. The usual practice is to deploy the ubiquitous password, and this might well be a suboptimal choice. Designing authentication for children requires acknowledgement of child-specific developmental challenges related to literacy, cognitive abilities and differing developmental stages. Under- standing the current state of play is essential, to deliver insights that can inform the development of child-centred authentication mechanisms and processes. We carried out a systematic literature review of all research related to children and authentication since 2000. A distinct research gap emerged from the analysis. Thus, we designed and administered a survey to school children in the United States (US), so as to gain insights into their current password usage and behaviors. This paper reports preliminary results from a case study of 189 children (part of a much larger research effort). The findings highlight age-related differences in children’s password understanding and practices. We also discovered that children confuse concepts of safety and security. We conclude by suggesting directions for future research. This paper reports on work in progress.},

Keeping hand written notes in hard copy is not a good choice as the accumulated papers would mess up child’s study space. Although there is high adoption of mobile application among children nowadays, but children are not educated to practice password to secure their personals in their primary school syllabus. Therefore, an application which can provide personal storage for children to store their notes in softcopy forms called Graphical Password Authentication for Child Personal Storage Application was proposed. The adoption of graphical password authentication in the proposed system is intended to cultivate children practice password to secure their files in an interesting method. The proposed system is developed in Android mobile application platform and the Object-oriented Mobile Application Development is applied as methodology of the project. The proposed system’s functional requirements are implemented according to user’s requirements and the application interfaces implementation also based on user’s characteristics that has been studied in literature reviews. The significance of the project is awareness on secure file keeping among the children. Children can use graphical password in their childhood age would be the advantage for them in the future because they would make a sense to protect privacy by setting up password. In terms of information security, the proposed system has mentioned some values that would be achieved which are authentication, confidentiality and availability.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Using authentication to secure data and accounts has grown to be a natural part of computing. Even if several authentication methods are in existence, using passwords remain the most common type of authentication. As long and complex passwords are encouraged by research studies and practitioners alike, computer users design passwords using strategies that enable them to remember their passwords. This paper aims to find strategies that allow for the generation of passwords that are both memorable and computationally secure. Design/methodology/approach: The study began with a literature review that was used to identify cognitive password creation strategies that facilitate the creation of passwords that are easy to remember. Using an action-based approach, attack models were created for the resulting creation strategies. The attack models were then used to calculate the entropy for passwords created with different strategies and related to a theoretical cracking time. Findings: The result of this study suggests that using phrases with four or more words as passwords will generate passwords that are easy to remember and hard to attack. Originality/value: This paper considers passwords from a socio-technical approach and provides insight into how passwords that are easy to remember and hard to crack can be generated. The results can be directly used to create password guidelines and training material that enables users to create usable and secure passwords.},

	abstract = {The explosion of the Internet provides a variety possibilities for communication, finding information and many other activities, turning into an essential tool in our modern everyday life. However, its huge expansion globally has created some serious safety issues, which require a special approach. One of these issues and perhaps the most important one concerns the safety of children on the Internet, as they are more exposed to dangers and threats in comparison with adults. In order to design effective measures against these threats and dangers deep understanding of minors' activities on the Internet, along with their motivation, is a first necessary step. It is shown in this report that minors' Internet activity tends heavily, and in an increasing manner, towards Online Social Networks (OSN). Thus, Internet filtering techniques designed and applied so far for child online protection need to be reconsidered and redesigned in a smarter way such as data analytics, advanced content analysis and data mining techniques are incorporated. OSN fake account identification, sexual content detection and flagging of multiple OSN accounts of the same person are examples that require such sophisticated techniques. This study deals with a literature review concerning the Internet activity and motivation of use by minors and presents in a coherent manner the identified risks and threats that children using the web and online social networks are exposed to. It also presents a systematic process for designing and developing modern and state of the art techniques to prevent minors' exposure to those risks and dangers.},

	abstract = {Usage of weak passwords for authentication within an organization can be exploited during cyberattacks leading to unauthorized account access, denial of service, data and identity theft, sabotage etc. Such attacks could bring financial and reputational losses apart from legal consequences. Organizational password policies came into being in an attempt to encourage users to create more complex and diverse passwords. However, it has been observed that people show similar behavior in adopting those policies and end up creating passwords with similar patterns. Security training has been found to be a popular mechanism in an enterprise setting, of which, game-based trainings have shown positive impact with an added advantage of being immersive. In this paper, we present a serious game-based training on creating password security awareness among enterprise users. The training involves promoting understanding among users about various common password heuristics during password creation. This study focuses on two research questions: 1) Can a game-based password awareness training teach participants about the various password heuristics? 2) Can such a training improve the organizational password diversity? With a participation of 4,906 employees from our enterprise in the study, we were able to observe effects of game-based training on password awareness. We also found insights during the study to show that users created diverse passwords.},

Cases like cyber-bully, online fraud, racial abuse, pornography and gambling had increased tremendously due to the lack of awareness and self-mechanism among Internet users to protect themselves from being victims to these acts. However, past research revealed that the level of awareness among Internet users is still low or moderate. One of the vital measures to be taken is to cultivate knowledge and awareness among Internet users from their early age, i.e., young children. Young children specifically, need to be educated to operate in a safe manner in cyberspace and to protect themselves in the process. The objective of this systematic review paper is to explore why it is so critical that modern learners are educated about the risks associated with being active in cyberspace and the strategies that stakeholders can use to promote cyber security education in schools. In this paper, few strategies are discussed as how cyber security education can be implemented in schools.},

Recent technological advances have mandated the necessity of exploring various aspects of cybersecurity. Rapid cyberisation with the introduction of smart devices has enforced both government and private organizations to create an awareness on cyber threats and cybersecurity. Developed countries like New Zealand has been a frontrunner in introducing new technology and in some cases has legally mandated to implement cybersecurity procedures in various sectors including educational institutions. Though, the necessity of such implementations are never questioned, however, there has been a continues debate on implementation framework particularly for school, bursary and undergraduate syllabus.This paper is divided into three parts. Firstly, the importance of cybersecurity awareness is established by presenting various statistics, followed by the current implementations for cybersecurity awareness in terms of courses, seminars etc. The results of a comprehensive survey among various age groups is presented which gives a generic opinion on different implementations. Finally, we propose a framework that leads to the process of implementing cybersecurity awareness.The survey provides a comprehensive understand of cyber security awareness. This work will contributes on understanding the cyber security awareness state of internet users, what are important aspects and statistics to be collected as well as on the important concepts of internet security that are to be considered while designing a survey. Further, the conclusions obtained from the survey result will guide the new works on cyber security awareness programmes.},

	abstract = {For elementary students, security and privacy education is anticipated to be more joyful when the knowledge is delivered in the form of a digital game-based learning activity. This paper details on the development of a novel learning platform that comprises a web-based Learning Content Management Systems (LCMS) and a mobile client application (app) for educating and raising young learners’ awareness on basic cybersecurity and privacy issues. The app, which comprises a suite of quick games, can be played either in standalone or in client/server mode and it is especially destined to elementary students. Further, due to the anytime and anywhere characteristics of the app, it can be experienced as a classroom or an outdoor learning activity. Contrary to analogous studies found in the literature so far, during the design phase of the app, our focus was not solely on its technological aspects, but we uniformly paid special attention to the educational factor by applying the Attention, Relevance, Confidence, and Satisfaction (ARCS) model of motivation. A preliminary evaluation of the app, including learning effectiveness, usability, and user’s satisfaction was conducted with 52 elementary-aged students. Among others, the results show that the interaction with the app significantly increases the mean performance of the participants by almost 20\%.},

	abstract = {The goal of this thesis is to study the implementation of a passphrase system that implements new creation policies, called StoryPass. We are motivated to do this research as current text-based authentication methods, such as the password, fail to provide adequate security and usability. We call our system StoryPass because we were inspired by previous research which states that information created with stories can be more memorable. The problem we address is the lack of research on secure and usable passphrase creation guidelines. Our main contributions include a theoretical security analysis, a controlled 39-day user study and an estimate of the security that the resulting passphrases provide. Our security estimates are mainly performed through an algorithm that uses n-grams to estimate the number of attempts required to successfully guess passphrases created in StoryPass. We were able to successfully guess 64\% of the passphrases collected during our 39-day user study, but with only a very large number of attempts. The passphrases which were not guessed generally contained slang and "non-words" which are words that are not found in standard dictionaries. Using a sentence-like structure in passphrases greatly improved usability. Memory errors were the leading cause of failed login; error correction techniques were used to prevent login failures from typographical errors. This thesis discusses how results from our user study can be used to help guide future passphrase creation policies. i},

As a consequence, children become actors in world where they use passwords to authenticate themselves from a very young age. As such, there is a need for guidance to inform educators and parents about how to prepare children for responsible password practice. Very little attention has been paid to determining which password-related principles young children should know, and the age at which this information should be imparted. To address this deficiency, we commenced by deriving an ontology of “best practice” password principles from official sources. These password principles encode essential knowledge for password users of all ages and provide a benchmark that can be used to ground a set of age-appropriate ontologies. We compared this benchmark “good practice” ontology to the advice provided by a wide-ranging snapshot of password-related children's books and parents’ online resources. We then consulted the research literature to identify the skills required to understand and apply each principle, and removed those that were unsuitable for young children. We then consulted parents of young children to help us to confirm the classification of the ontology's principles in terms of age appropriateness. Parents also helped us to rephrase each principle to maximise accessibility and understandability for each age group. We conclude with our final set of three age-appropriate password best practice ontologies as a helpful resource for early education professionals and parents.},

We present an experiment in which children at Dutch primary schools received an anti- phishing training. The subjects were subsequently tested for their ability to distinguish phishing from non-phishing. A control group was used to control for external effects. Fur- thermore, the subjects received a re-test after several weeks to measure how well the children retained the training. The training improved the children’s overall score by 14\%. The improvement was mostly caused by an increased score on the questions where they had to detect phishing. The score on recognizing legitimate emails was not affected by the train- ing. We found that the improved phishing score returned to pre-training levels after four weeks. Conversely, the score of recognition of legitimate emails increased over time. Af- ter four weeks, trained pupils scored significantly better in recognizing legitimate emails than their untrained counter- parts. Age had a positive effect on the score (i.e., older children scored higher than younger ones); but sex had no significant influence. In conclusion, educating children to improve their ability to detect phishing works in the short term only. However, children go to school regularly, making it easier to educate them than adults. An increased focus on the cybersecurity of children is essential to improve overall cybersecurity in the future.},

These elements are (1) leadership and policies, (2) infrastructure, (3) education, and (4) standards and inspection. The study used a UK-approved measurement tool (360safe) to measure the cybersafety maturity of schools within South Africa, using five levels of compliance (Level 1: full compliance, to Level 5: no compliance). The data analysis clearly indicated that all the schools that participated in the study had a significantly low level of cybersafety maturity and compliance. Schools are starting to adopt technology as part of their educational and social approach to prepare learners for the future, but there is a clear lack of supporting cybersafety awareness, policies, practices and procedures within South African schools.

	abstract = {Technology evolves at such a rapid pace nowadays, keeping up with education on cyber security tends to fall. Even with the rising threats, people put their personal information in their computers without knowing who could access the information. Many people keep their personal information online when they do shopping, banking, or on social media. These online activities attract adversaries that may have malicious attentions. The lack of cyber security practices is evident as we often hear the news of large-scale cyberattack incidents against financial institutions that leads to breach of personal information of their users. Cyber-attacks can have long term damaging effects. Cybersecurity awareness is necessary to start at an early age. If this subject is delivered to young users as an interactive tutorial, using game-based principles, then it is more likely to be learned in an entertaining manner. Hence, this thesis project focuses on a framework development for interactive and engaging cybersecurity education and its evaluation. The framework is developed to educate the users various cybersecurity related topics, such as malware, web security, and network security. It consists four stages for each topic: information, interaction, explanation, and assessment. In the information module, the user is presented details related to the topic. To maintain users’ interest, interaction module allows users to interrelate with common hacking attacks from real life situations. Explanation module provides the discussion of interaction module and introduces defense techniques. The users are tested in the Assessment module to measure their learning to be able to advance to next levels within the same topic. The developed framework is customizable since more modules can be integrated and existing modules can be swiftly modified. In addition, multiple surveys were conducted to analyze whether this framework explains the cybersecurity topics easily},

	title = {Identifying research challenges in post quantum cryptography migration and cryptographic agility},
	abstract = {The implications of sufficiently large quantum computers for widely used public-key cryptography is well-documented and increasingly discussed by the security community. An April 2016 report by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), notably, calls out the need for new standards to replace cryptosystems based on integer factorization and discrete logarithm problems, which have been shown to be vulnerable to Shor's quantum algorithm for prime factorization. Specifically, widely used RSA, ECDSA, ECDH, and DSA cryptosystems will need to be replaced by post-quantum cryptography (PQC) alternatives (also known as quantum-resistant or quantum-safe cryptography). Failure to transition before sufficiently powerful quantum computers are realized will jeopardize the security of public key cryptosystems which are widely deployed within communication protocols, digital signing mechanisms, authentication frameworks, and more. To avoid this, NIST has actively led a PQC standardization effort since 2016, leveraging a large and international research community. The effort is expected to take six or more years to vet proposals, and to select alternatives that are believed to be secure against both quantum and classical computers. Meanwhile, many point out the urgency of transition due to the threat of "record now, exploit later" in which encrypted information assets are captured and stored today by an adversary for attack later when scaled quantum computers become available. While NIST's standardization effort aims to determine which PQC algorithms are robust enough to provide suitable alternatives for the threat of quantum computers, that effort does not address the problem of migration from today's widely deployed algorithms to future PQC alternatives across the diversity of computer systems that serve our society. Today, there are more than 4.1 billion Internet users, nearly 2 billion websites, and more than 3 trillion dollars in retail activity associated with the Internet.[5] Underlying this explosive digital transformation of the world as we know it are security and privacy technologies relying on public key cryptographic standards at many layers. The extensiveness of public key cryptography usage across the Internet means that an industry-wide migration to quantum safe cryptography standards (i.e., PQC) will be a massive undertaking, and one that is complicated by the layered complexity and heterogeneity of the worldwide compute infrastructure we operate. It will challenge, domain by domain, the fabric of our compute infrastructure and involve myriad organizations, from those who contribute widely used software and hardware components to the much larger number of operators who deploy and manage the constituent pieces of secure infrastructure globally. It is no wonder that prior history shows cryptographic migrations (e.g., 3DES to AES, MD5 to SHA1, SHA1 to SHA2, RSA to ECC) to take a decade or more before completion. On January 31-February 1, 2019, the Computing Community Consortium (CCC) held a workshop in Washington, D.C. to discuss research challenges associated with PQC migration. Entitled, "Identifying Research Challenges in Post Quantum Cryptography Migration and Cryptographic Agility", participants came from three distinct yet related communities: cryptographers contributing to the NIST PQC standards effort, applied cryptographers with expertise in creating cryptographic solutions and implementing cryptography in real-world settings, and industry practitioners with expertise in deploying cryptographic standards within products and compute infrastructures. Discussion centered around two key themes: identifying constituent challenges in PQC migration and imagining a new science of "cryptographic agility". Key findings for PQC migration include: • There is an important need for research to understand and quantify the implications of replacing today's public cryptography algorithms (e.g., RSA, ECDH, ECDSA, DSA) with PQC alternatives across a wide variety of implementation and deployment contexts. • Given that PQC algorithms generally have greater computation, memory, storage, and communication requirements (e.g., larger key sizes, more complex algorithms, or both), research and prototyping is needed to better understand performance, security, and implementation considerations. • Research is needed on approaches to introducing new PQC algorithms (e.g., hybrids) within live systems that must remain interoperable with other systems during the period of massive industry migration. This includes such areas as formal modeling, automated tools, and approaching transition in complex infrastructures. Key findings for cryptographic agility include: • There is a need to broaden and recast traditional notions of cryptographic agility in light of the size and complexity of global PQC migration. A new science of cryptographic agility should include an expanded set of goals, a more comprehensive set of compute domains, a broader range of agility modalities and time scales, and the full canon of security research methodologies. • Research on cryptographic agility should include frameworks and architectures that enable agility across a wide variety of compute contexts, usable interfaces addressing various user roles, a better understanding of security and complexity tradeoffs, and other defining challenges. • Context agility, or cryptographic frameworks that automatically select among algorithms and configuration based on the context of use, represents a long-term research vision that could shape the field. • Cryptographic agility, independent of PQC migration, offers the benefit of making security systems more robust against algorithmic breakthroughs, revealed implementation flaws, emerging hardware accelerators, and other threats. It enables change in response to evolving security policy within an organization and support for new cryptographic features. • In the context of PQC, it enables agility across multiple standards likely to be approved by NIST. Additional findings include: • Fundamental research is needed on policy, process, and people since these determine whether and when PQC adoption occurs at all. • Research is needed on the frontiers of cryptography; that is, how PQC migration and cryptographic agility will apply to newer cryptography fields like secure multi-party computation, fully homomorphic encryption, blockchain, and more.},

Questions have been raised about adequately protecting children’s privacy, as schooling, play and socialising went almost exclusively online. However, due to the historical lack of children’s rights being embedded throughout decision-making processes (including important participation rights), the effects of the increased surveillance as a result of the pandemic have not been thoroughly considered. This article pursues three objectives. First, it seeks to develop the literature on the enabling aspects of privacy for children in relation to education and play. Second, it seeks to expand the discussion on the exploitative risks endemic in not protecting children’s privacy, including not only violent harms, but commercial exploitation. Third, it suggests some policy responses that will more effectively embed a children’s rights framework beyond the ‘parental control’ provisions that dominate child-specific data protection frameworks.},

A possible alternative to using text for authentication systems for young children is drawings. In this paper, we describe an authentication system called KidsDoodlePass, which use simple drawings (“doodles”) that the children themselves create. An initial evaluation of the system was undertaken with 19 children aged 6 to 9 years of age. Success of logging in with KidsDoodlePass was high, only on few occasions did a child need more than one attempt, demonstrating that the system is effective. Selection times dropped significantly on the second use of the KidsPassDoodle and were typically under 10 s per grid. Most children thought their KidsDoodlePass would be easier to remember than a text password, a significant proportion. These positive results suggest that KidsDoodlePass could be a useful mechanism for young children to use as a first experience of authentication and a useful first step toward adult authentication systems.},

	abstract = {Security issues in text-based password authentication are rarely caused by technical issues, but rather by the limitations of human memory, and human perceptions together with their consequential responses. This study introduces a new user-friendly guideline approach to password creation, including persuasive messages that motivate and influence users to select more secure and memorable text passwords without overburdening their memory. From a broad understanding of human factors-caused security problems, we offer a reliable solution by encouraging users to create their own formula to compose passwords. A study has been conducted to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed password guidelines. Its results suggest that the password creation methods and persuasive message provided to users convinced them to create cryptographically strong and memorable passwords. Participants were divided into two groups in the study. The participants in the experimental group who were given several password creation methods along with a persuasive message created more secure and memorable passwords than the participants in the control group who were asked to comply with the usual strict password creation rules. The study also suggests that our password creation methods are much more efficient than strict password policy rules. The security and usability evaluation of the proposed password guideline showed that simple improvements such as adding persuasive text to the usual password guidelines consisting of several password restriction rules make significant changes to the strength and memorability of passwords. The proposed password guidelines are a low-cost solution to the problem of improving the security and usability of text-based passwords.},

However, the cybersecurity domain encompasses an extensive set of concepts, which can be taught in different ways and contexts. To understand the state of the art of cybersecurity education and related research, we examine papers from the ACM SIGCSE and ACM ITiCSE conferences. From 2010 to 2019, a total of 1,748 papers were published at these conferences, and 71 of them focus on cybersecurity education. The papers discuss courses, tools, exercises, and teaching approaches. For each paper, we map the covered topics, teaching context, evaluation methods, impact, and the community of authors.We discovered that the technical topic areas are evenly covered (the most prominent being secure programming, network security, and offensive security), and human aspects, such as privacy and social engineering, are present as well. The interventions described in SIGCSE and ITiCSE papers predominantly focus on tertiary education in the USA. The subsequent evaluation mostly consists of collecting students' subjective perceptions via questionnaires. However, less than a third of the papers provide supplementary materials for other educators, and none of the authors published their dataset. Our results provide orientation in the area, a synthesis of trends, and implications for further research. Therefore, they are relevant for instructors, researchers, and anyone new in the field of cybersecurity education. The information we collected and synthesized from individual papers are organized in a publicly available dataset.},

This progress is accompanied by weekly media reports on security incidents affecting the IT we use on a daily basis. In order to provide orientation in this seemingly "insecure"digital world, it is necessary for every digital citizen to have a basic knowledge of the field of IT security. Current curricula for secondary CS education already try to cover some aspects of IT security - however, practical reports suggest that some important security-related topics have not yet been considered. Based on this assumption, we use a Qualitative Content Analysis to compare international as well as German secondary school curricula with an up-to-date body of knowledge of IT security to identify the gap to knowledge areas in current curricula. Our results show that there is not only a lack of more in-depth topics, e. g. involving newer technologies, like internet-of-things security, the knowledge for the development of secure software - but also human factors in IT security are hardly considered in any curriculum. For further research, the results support the adjustment of relevant IT security concepts for secondary CS education.},

Contextual integrity equates privacy with appropriate flows of information, and we show how children’s perceptions of the appropriateness of disclosing a password varied across contexts. We explain why privacy literacy should focus on norms rather than rules and discuss how adults can use learning moments to strengthen children’s privacy literacy.

To better understand what privacy and security mean to elementary school educators, we conducted nine focus groups with 25 educators across three metropolitan regions in the northeast U.S. Our findings suggest that technology use is an integral part of elementary school classrooms, that educators consider digital privacy and security through the lens of curricular and classroom management goals, and that lessons to teach children about digital privacy and security are rare. Using Bronfenbrenner’s ecological systems theory, we identify design opportunities to help educators integrate privacy and security into decisions about digital technology use and to help children learn about digital privacy and security.},

This transformation is driven by mobility, wireless interfaces, and built-in sensors that these smart devices offer in order to enable blended and context-sensitive mobile learning (m-Learning) activities. Thus, m-Learning is becoming more independent and ubiquitous (u-Learning). In order to identify and analyze the main trends and the future challenging issues involved in designing mGBL learning strategies, as well as to bring to the foreground important issues pertaining to mobile and context-aware ubiquitous GBL, the work at hand conducts a comprehensive survey of this particular area. Specifically, it introduces and applies a six-dimensional framework consisted of Spatio-temporal, Collaboration/Social, Session, Personalization, Data security \& privacy, and Pedagogy, with the aim of scrutinizing the contributions in the field of mGBL published from 2004 to 2016. It was found that the transition to mGBL presents several difficulties, and therefore cannot be conceived as a simple and quick modification of existing GBL solutions. In this respect, this work is anticipated to foster the development of well-designed solutions that are intensive not only in their technological aspect, but in pedagogical qualities as well.},

	abstract = {This work outlines a study comparing graphical and textual passwords. A study was conducted with 13 children between the ages of six and twelve years old. These participants created their own textual and graphical passwords for fictional Web sites and after two weeks, participants returned and attempted to recall the usernames and passwords that they created. Our preliminary results showed that graphical passwords had a lower success rate and participants were less likely to access their accounts when using graphical passwords. Whether using graphical or textual passwords, children succeeded with generalities, but struggled with specifics.},

	abstract = {Cybersecurity is critical to the national infrastructure, federal and local government, military, industry, and personal privacy. To defend the U.S. against the cyber threats, a significant demand for skilled cybersecurity workforce is predicted in government and industrial sectors. To address this issue, National Security Agency and the National Science Foundation jointly funded GenCyber program to stimulate the K-12 students' interest in the cybersecurity field and raise their awareness of cybersecurity and safe online behavior. Purdue University Northwest has successfully launched four GenCyber summer camps in 2016 and 2017 to 181 high school students, with 51.3\% underrepresented minority ratio (Africa American and Hispanics), and about 2:1 male to female ratio. We delivered GenCyber summer camp activities in the format of game based learning and hands-on labs. The use of game-based learning in the camp was an excellent platform to teach concepts of cyber security principles. For example, in Cyber Defense Tower Game, students need to protect their servers from the different types of cyber-attack. They need to select the correct type of defense to stop each wave of cyber-attack. As the students advanced through the game, combinations of the different attacks would come faster, making it more difficult for the students to defend their servers. This game was well received by the students, support staffs, instructors, and site visit team. Learning through these activities provided high school students with an immersive, learner-centered experience, which has been proven very effective on cybersecurity awareness training and practical skill acquisition for learners from diverse backgrounds. Further analysis of survey data revealed that the gamification of cybersecurity education to raise students' interests in computer science and cybersecurity was more effective in male high school students than in female students.},

We investigate children's username and password understanding and practices from the perspective of both children and adults within the context of three security categories: credential composition (e.g. length of password), performance (e.g. time to enter), and credential mechanisms (e.g; a pattern or characters). We conducted a semi-structured interview with 22 children and an online survey with 33 adult participants (parents and teachers) to determine their practices and involvement in facilitating authentication for their children. Our study illustrates how children have a limited understanding of authentication, and that there are differences between children's and adult's understanding of good authentication and security practices, and what they actually do.},

	doi = {10.3390/sym12091502},
	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has deepened social and educational asymmetries in some developing countries, such as Romania. Tele-education failed to replace face-to-face education due to the lack of symmetrical policy, connectivity, infrastructure, digitalized educational materials and digital competences. Was this issue predictable and, hence, the stakeholders' mission failed? Our qualitative research aims at analyzing, in depth, these digitalization asymmetries, with a sample formed of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) specialists working for/with Romanian 1-4 International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) schools. The collected primary data were processed with Atlas.ti 8. The results emphasize major key areas to be addressed with future public symmetrical policy and change management strategies: equal access to infrastructure, as well as development of compulsory and complementary digital skills (for teachers and students). The necessity to support school management in accessing funding is also required to enhance digitalization.},
